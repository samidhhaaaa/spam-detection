Spam Detection System for Emails and SMS

This project showcases a powerful machine learning-based spam detection system designed to classify SMS and email messages as spam or ham (non-spam). By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques—such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization—the system cleans and prepares text data for analysis. Using TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features, the Naive Bayes algorithm then efficiently classifies messages, delivering high accuracy in spam detection.

Key Features:
Comprehensive text preprocessing: Includes cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
TF-IDF vectorization: Effectively extracts meaningful features from text.
Naive Bayes classifier: Delivers reliable and high-performance message classification.
Accurate spam detection: Ensures user communication safety and efficiency.

Technologies Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Pandas
NumPy

Usage: This project can be deployed to filter out spam messages from various communication channels, enhancing user experience and security. Perfect for educational purposes or practical spam filtering applications.
